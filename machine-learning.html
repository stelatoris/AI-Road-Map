        <h2>Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves teaching machines to learn from data.
            It is used in a wide range of applications, from image and speech recognition to natural language processing
            and predictive analytics. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Supervised learning</li>
            <li>Unsupervised learning</li>
            <li>Reinforcement learning</li>
            <li>Overfitting and underfitting</li>
            <li>Training and test sets</li>
            <li>Validation and cross-validation</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Regression</h2>
        <p>Regression is a type of supervised learning that involves predicting a continuous output variable based on
            one or more input variables. It is used in many applications, such as stock market forecasting, weather
            prediction, and medical diagnosis. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linear regression</li>
            <li>Multiple regression</li>
            <li>Logistic regression</li>
            <li>Ridge regression and Lasso regression</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Classification</h2>
        <p>Classification is another type of supervised learning that involves predicting a categorical output variable
            based on one or more input variables. It is used in many applications, such as email spam filtering, fraud
            detection, and image recognition. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Decision trees</li>
            <li>Random forests</li>
            <li>Support vector machines</li>
            <li>Naive Bayes</li>
            <li>k-Nearest Neighbors</li>
            <li>Neural networks</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2>
        <p>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that involves finding patterns in data without a
            predefined output variable. It is used in many applications, such as market segmentation, anomaly detection,
            and image compression. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clustering</li>
            <li>Principal component analysis</li>
            <li>Independent component analysis</li>
            <li>Autoencoders</li>
        </ul>
