        <h2>Data Collection and Preparation</h2>
        <p>Data collection and preparation is the process of gathering and cleaning data so that it can be analyzed.
            Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data sources, such as APIs, databases, and web scraping</li>
            <li>Data cleaning and preprocessing, such as dealing with missing values and outliers</li>
            <li>Data wrangling, such as merging and reshaping data sets</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Data Exploration and Visualization</h2>
        <p>Data exploration and visualization is the process of gaining insight into the data by using visualizations
            and statistical analysis. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, and mode</li>
            <li>Data visualization, such as scatter plots and heat maps</li>
            <li>Dimensionality reduction, such as principal component analysis</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Predictive Modeling</h2>
        <p>Predictive modeling is the process of using machine learning algorithms to make predictions about future
            events based on historical data. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Supervised learning, such as linear regression and classification</li>
            <li>Unsupervised learning, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction</li>
            <li>Model evaluation and selection</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Machine Learning in Production</h2>
        <p>Machine learning in production is the process of deploying machine learning models to real-world
            applications. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Model deployment using APIs and cloud services</li>
            <li>Monitoring and updating machine learning models</li>
            <li>Model interpretation and explainability</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
        <p>Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks to perform
            complex tasks. Topics to focus on include:</p>
