        <h2>Markov Decision Processes</h2>
        <p>Markov decision processes are a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making problems. Topics to focus
            on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>States and actions</li>
            <li>Rewards and value functions</li>
            <li>Policy and optimal policy</li>
            <li>Discounted future rewards and Bellman equations</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Q-Learning</h2>
        <p>Q-learning is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm that learns a policy by iteratively improving an
            estimate of the optimal action-value function. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Off-policy learning and the Q-learning algorithm</li>
            <li>Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy</li>
            <li>Experience replay and target network</li>
            <li>Deep Q-networks and double Q-learning</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Policy Gradients</h2>
        <p>Policy gradients is a family of reinforcement learning algorithms that directly learn a parameterized policy
            that maximizes the expected reward. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Policy gradients and the policy gradient theorem</li>
            <li>REINFORCE algorithm and baseline</li>
            <li>Actor-critic algorithm and advantage function</li>
            <li>Proximal policy optimization (PPO) and trust region policy optimization (TRPO)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Actor-Critic Methods</h2>
        <p>Actor-critic methods are a family of reinforcement learning algorithms that learn both a policy and a value
            function. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Actor-critic architecture and the advantage function</li>
            <li>A3C and A2C algorithms</li>
            <li>Distributed reinforcement learning</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</h2>
        <p>Model-based reinforcement learning is a family of reinforcement learning algorithms that learn a model of the
            environment and use it to improve the policy. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Model-based and model-free reinforcement learning</li>
            <li>Model-based algorithms, such as Dyna and MBIE</li>
            <li>Planning and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)</li>
        </ul>
