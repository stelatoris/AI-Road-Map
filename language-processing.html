        <h2>Text Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>Text preprocessing is the process of cleaning and transforming raw text into a more usable format for
            analysis. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tokenization, such as word and sentence tokenization</li>
            <li>Part-of-speech tagging</li>
            <li>Named entity recognition</li>
            <li>Stemming and lemmatization</li>
            <li>Stop word removal and punctuation removal</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Text Representation</h2>
        <p>Text representation is the process of converting raw text into a numerical format that can be used for
            analysis. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bag-of-words model</li>
            <li>Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) model</li>
            <li>Word embeddings, such as Word2Vec and GloVe</li>
            <li>Document embeddings, such as Doc2Vec</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Text Classification</h2>
        <p>Text classification is the process of assigning categories or labels to a text document. Topics to focus on
            include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Supervised learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, decision trees, and support vector machines (SVMs)
            </li>
            <li>Deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks
                (RNNs)</li>
            <li>Multi-label classification</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling</h2>
        <p>Sequence-to-sequence modeling is a type of neural network architecture used for tasks such as machine
            translation and text summarization. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encoder-decoder architecture</li>
            <li>Attention mechanisms</li>
            <li>Beam search and greedy decoding</li>
            <li>Applications, such as machine translation and text summarization</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Language Generation</h2>
        <p>Language generation is the process of generating new text that is similar in style and tone to existing text.
            Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Generative language models, such as GPT-2 and BERT</li>
            <li>Conditional language models, such as GPT-3 and T5</li>
            <li>Applications, such as chatbots and text completion</li>
        </ul>
