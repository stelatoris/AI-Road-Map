        <h2>Data Structures</h2>
        <p>Data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science and are essential for efficient processing of
            data. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arrays</li>
            <li>Linked lists</li>
            <li>Stacks and queues</li>
            <li>Trees and graphs</li>
            <li>Hash tables</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Algorithm Design and Analysis</h2>
        <p>Algorithm design is the process of creating a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem, while algorithm
            analysis is the process of evaluating the efficiency and correctness of an algorithm. Topics to focus on
            include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sorting and searching algorithms</li>
            <li>Divide-and-conquer algorithms</li>
            <li>Dynamic programming</li>
            <li>Greedy algorithms</li>
            <li>Backtracking algorithms</li>
            <li>Graph algorithms</li>
            <li>Analysis of algorithms using time and space complexity</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Graph Theory</h2>
        <p>Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations
            between objects. Graph theory is used in many areas of computer science, such as network analysis, social
            network analysis, and image segmentation. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Graph representation using matrices and lists</li>
            <li>Graph traversal algorithms</li>
            <li>Minimum spanning tree algorithms</li>
            <li>Shortest path algorithms</li>
            <li>Graph coloring algorithms</li>
            <li>Topological sorting</li>
        </ul>
