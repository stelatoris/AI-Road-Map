        <h2>Linear Algebra</h2>
        <p>Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations and their representations in
            vector spaces. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vectors and matrices</li>
            <li>Systems of linear equations</li>
            <li>Matrix operations, such as multiplication, inversion, and transpose</li>
            <li>Vector spaces and subspaces</li>
            <li>Eigenvalues and eigenvectors</li>
            <li>Applications in machine learning, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value
                decomposition (SVD)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Calculus</h2>
        <p>Calculus is the branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and accumulation. Topics to focus on
            include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Limits and continuity</li>
            <li>Differentiation and its applications, such as optimization and gradient descent</li>
            <li>Integration and its applications, such as finding areas and volumes</li>
            <li>Sequences and series</li>
            <li>Applications in machine learning, such as backpropagation and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Probability and Statistics</h2>
        <p>Probability and statistics are branches of mathematics that deal with uncertainty and data analysis. Topics
            to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic probability theory, such as conditional probability and Bayes' theorem</li>
            <li>Random variables and probability distributions, such as the normal distribution and the binomial
                distribution</li>
            <li>Descriptive statistics, such as measures of central tendency and variability</li>
            <li>Inferential statistics, such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals</li>
            <li>Regression analysis and its applications, such as linear regression and logistic regression</li>
            <li>Applications in machine learning, such as clustering and decision trees</li>
        </ul>
