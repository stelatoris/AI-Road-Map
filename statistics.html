        <h2>Descriptive Statistics</h2>
        <p>Descriptive statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with summarizing and visualizing data. Topics to
            focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Measures of central tendency, such as mean, median, and mode</li>
            <li>Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation</li>
            <li>Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Inferential Statistics</h2>
        <p>Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with making predictions and drawing conclusions
            about a population based on a sample of data. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hypothesis testing and significance</li>
            <li>Confidence intervals</li>
            <li>Regression analysis</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Probability Theory</h2>
        <p>Probability theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of random events. Topics to focus on
            include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Probability distributions, such as normal, binomial, and Poisson</li>
            <li>Conditional probability</li>
            <li>Bayesian probability</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Statistical Learning</h2>
        <p>Statistical learning is a branch of machine learning that deals with the development of algorithms that can
            learn from data and make predictions. Topics to focus on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linear regression</li>
            <li>Logistic regression</li>
            <li>Decision trees</li>
            <li>Random forests</li>
            <li>Support vector machines</li>
            <li>Neural networks</li>
            <li>Clustering</li>
        </ul>
